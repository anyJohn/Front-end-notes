# 前端 git 工作流规范

## Background

plugins such as ESLint, Prettier,Commitizen, can help us format codes & commit-msg and find out mistakes.Some how,maybe someone will ignore warnings,and commit & push his/her codes.  
So we need some way to ensure local codes or commit-msg having passed check before pushing to remote hub.

### What is git hooks

Git triggers scripts while doing some important operations,that called hooks.There 2 kind of hooks: client and server.  
We use client hooks usually.Hooks are usually stored in .git/hooks directory.

if Hooks that execute before commit return with non-zero value,git will abort the commit

There are four hooks that we use frequently:

- pre-commit: Execute before commit-msg entered.It be used to check snapshot for commit.We can use it to check whether code styles are consistent.
- prepare-commit-msg: Execute before start commit-msg editor,and after default message created.
- commit-msg: Accept some parameters that storage paths of temp files contains current commit message. We can use it to check statuses of projects or commit messages.
- post-commit: Usually use to notify user.

### What is husky
